# **Carolina Herrera Figueroa**

This is my website for CRIM 250 -Statistics for the Social Sciences during the Fall of 2021. Here I will be posting my work and answers for the homework assignments along with my work for the exams after those have been graded. This is my first time working with R and gitbub! 

# **About me** 

I am a junior in the College double majoring in Criminology and Italian Studies. I was born in Uruguay, but I am from northern New Jersey - abotu a 15 minute train ride to NYC! At Penn I volunteer as Peer Advisor, and also participate in the Italian Club and Penn Cinema Initiative.
