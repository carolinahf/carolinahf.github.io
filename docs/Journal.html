<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p><strong>Collaborators: Eliza Epstein. </strong></p>
<p>This assignment is due on Canvas on Monday 9/20 before class, at 10:15 am. Include the name of anyone with whom you collaborated at the top of the assignment.</p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Install the datasets package on the console below using <code>install.packages("datasets")</code>. Now load the library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(datasets)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: I loaded the library!</p>
<p>Load the USArrests dataset and rename it <code>dat</code>. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there’s no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat&lt;-USArrests</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It is nice to rename data because we want to be able to replicate our analysis without messing up the original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat$state &lt;- tolower(rownames(USArrests))</code></pre>
<p>List the variables contained in the dataset <code>USArrests</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Murder&quot;   &quot;Assault&quot;  &quot;UrbanPop&quot; &quot;Rape&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The four variables contained in this dataset are Murder, Assault, UrbanPop and Rape.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Murder is a categorical variable, according to the DVB chapter. — FALSE: It’s a quantitative variable.</p>
<p>What R Type of variable is it?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It is a character R Type variable. — FALSE: It’s a numeriical varable.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: In this dataset we have the number of arrests per 100,000 residents for each of the following categories: assault, murder and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>Draw a histogram of <code>Murder</code> with proper labels and title.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: I chose to make a barplot instead of a histogram because it made more sense to me, considering that the data is categorical. I thought it would be clearer if each bar represented a state, which is why I decided to label the x-axis with the names of the states and the y-axis the number of arrests for murder per 100,000. In the code las=2 simply means that I wanted that state labels to be perpendicular to the x-axis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Murder, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for murder per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Murder Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Min: 0.800, 1st Q: 4.075, Median 7.250, Mean 7.788, 3rd Q 11.250, Max 17.400 —– The mean is 7.788 and the median is 7.250. On average there were 7.788 (mean) arrests for murder per 100,000 residents in each state in 1973. The median tells us where the middle of the data set is. Since the mean is higher than the median we could say the distribution or arrests for murder per 100,000 in 1973 is positively skewed. A quartile represents 1/4 of the data, for examples the 1st Q is 4.075 and this tells us that 1/4 of the data lies below 4.075 arrests per 100,000. I think R only gives us the 1st and 3rd Quartiles because the median is equal to the 2nd Quartile.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-7" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Repeat the same steps you followed for <code>Murder</code>, for the variables <code>Assault</code> and <code>Rape</code>. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command <code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))</code> and then plotting each of the three.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Assault, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for assault per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Assault Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Rape, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for rape per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Rape Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))
state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Murder, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for murder per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Murder Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)

state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Assault, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for assault per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Assault Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)

state.names = row.names(USArrests)
barplot(USArrests$Rape, names.arg = state.names, las = 2, ylab = &quot;Arrest Rate for rape per 100,000&quot;, main = &quot;Rape Rate in the United States in 1973&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Par can be used to set different parameters and can allow us to create a single graph from many.</p>
<p>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: By plotting histograms together (or in this case bar charts) we can see patterns more clearly. It becomes easier to compare the rates of arrest per 100,000 residents for each category across the states.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p>In the console below (not in text), type <code>install.packages("maps")</code> and press Enter, and then type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.</p>
<p>Run this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;maps&#39;) 
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) 

ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$lat)</code></pre>
<p>What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:The code allows us to make a heat map of arrests for murder per 100,000 in the USA. The first line tells R that we want to make a heat map according to states and that we want to use the data of arrests for murder to fill in each state. The second line creates the map and the last line expands the range to fit in all possible values.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:The data consists of 171 rows and 7 columns.</p>
<p>#Problem 2: Variables <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The variables in this data set are: mjage, cigage, iralcage, age2, sexatract, speakengl, irsex. (mjage) looks at how old the individual was the first time they used marijuana or hashish, (cigage) is have they ever smoked part of a cigarette, (iralcage) looks at how old the individual was when they first tried alcohol, (age2) represents their coded age, (irsex) represents their gender, (sexatract) looks at what best describes their sexual atractment and (speakengl) represents how well the individual speaks English. These are all categorical variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;mjage&quot;     &quot;cigage&quot;    &quot;iralcage&quot;  &quot;age2&quot;      &quot;sexatract&quot; &quot;speakengl&quot;
## [7] &quot;irsex&quot;</code></pre>
<p>What is this dataset about? Who collected the data, what kind of sample is it, and what was the purpose of generating the data? <strong>Answer</strong>: This dataset is about drug and alcohol use. It was collected using the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, and this is a random sample of the first 1000 cases of the survey. The purpose of generating the data was to perhaps be able to study the relationship between drug use and other variables such as age or gender. I think the results could perhaps be used to allocate resources to individuals or groups at highest risk of an early onset of drug use.</p>
<hr />
<p>#Problem 3: Age and gender What is the age distribution of the sample like? Make sure you read the codebook to know what the variable values mean. <strong>Answer</strong>: The age distribution of the sample is skewed with most individuals being between the ages of 35-49 years old, where the peak and the mean of the data is located, as shown by Figure 1. The lowest age of a respondent was 15 years old. I think those over 65 years old are also underrepresented in the sample.</p>

<p>Do you think this age distribution representative of the US population? Why or why not? ANSWER: I think this age distribution is not representative of the US population because it suggests that the population is mostly comprised of individuals between the age of 35-49 years old.</p>
<p>Is the sample balanced in terms of gender? If not, are there more females or males? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The same seems to be relatively balanced in terms of gender, but there are slightly more males than females. The bar chart (Figure 2) shows us that the bar for code “1” which represents males in the codebook is taller, meaning our sample has more males.</p>

<p>Use this code to draw a stacked bar plot to view the relationship between sex and age. What can you conclude from this plot? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: This plot shows us that for most age categories an equal number of males and females were surveyed, with the exception of a few. It seems that the younger the participants were the more likely it was that the sample consisted of mostly males or mostly females, but it was not even. For example, for age categories 6 and 7, which translates to the respondents being 17 or 18 years old, the data is made up of males only. Starting at age category 11 we see a sample more evenly split among males and females.</p>

<h2>Problem 4: Substance use</h2>
<p>For which of the three substances included in the dataset (marijuana, alcohol, and cigarettes) do individuals tend to use the substance earlier? <strong>Answer</strong>: Individuals tends to use alcohol earlier, it was reported being consumed as early as 16 years old, compared with 18 years old for marijuana/hashnish and 21 years old for cigarettes. We can also see that 25% of the respondents were under the age of 29 when they tried alcohol for the first time, compared to 25% being below 34 years old the first time they tried marijuana/hashish and 25% of those who respondents who were under 49 years old when theey started smoking cigarettes. Alcohol is also the only substance in our sample that respondents tried for the first time under the age of 18.</p>

<h2>Problem 5: Sexual attraction</h2>
<p>What does the distribution of sexual attraction look like? Is this what you expected? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The distribution of sexual attraction is skewed, with a great majority of individuals reporting as being attracted only to the opposite sex. I was not surprised to see such a high number of individuals reporting to be heterosexual, but rather the difference between those who reported to be heterosexual and those who reported to be homosexual. I think we should keep in mind that it’s possible that some individuals may have chosen to not report accurately out of fear of embarassment.</p>

<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What is the distribution of sexual attraction by gender? <strong>Answer</strong>: The distribution of sexual attraction by gender is interesting because those who identify as strongly being heterosexual (1 on the codebook) are mostly males, while those who identify as being “mostly heterosexual” are mostly female. I thought this was interesting to see because it may be showing us the importance of the wording of the question since males were more likley to choose the option that strongly asserted their sexuality. In our sample of 1,000 individuals, those who identified as bisexual were only female. There was an even split between genders among those who identified as being attracted only to the same sex.</p>

<h2>Problem 6: English speaking</h2>
<p>What does the distribution of English speaking look like in the sample? Is this what you might expect for a random sample of the US population? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The distribution of English speaking looks very skewed in the sample, with the majority of individuals speaking English very well. The barplot shows us that over 150 individuals speak English very well while about 10 speak English not well. This is not what I would expect of a random sample of the US population, I expected to see a greater number of individuals who spoke English “well” and “not well” considering that English is not the nativie language for a great portion of the population. I didn’t expect the data to be as skewed at it is.</p>
<p>Are there more English speaker females or males? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: There are more English speaking males, and in our sample none fall under the category of speaking English “not well”, represented by the bar labeled “3” on our plot.</p>

<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>The age distribution of the sample is what is would have expected to see. Looking at figure 1 we can see that a great portion of the victims are between the age of 30-35. Usually people between this age are more likely to be involved in interactions with the police. For example, I wasn’t expecting a large number of victims to be either under the age of 20, nor over the age of 45 and the histogram shows that to be true. The distribution is also unimodal and positvely skewed to the right. </strong></p>

<p><strong>To understand the center of the age distribution I would use a median because it is resistant to values that are extremely large or small. Since the data is skewed to the right our mean would also be pulled to the right, giving us a number that does not represent the true center of the distribution. The median of the age distribution is 35 years old, meaning that the center of our data is located here. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 shows us that most of the victims were male, with a very small number identifying as female. I don’t find this surprising because usually when we hear about fatal police shootings the victims are always male. This could be either because they are more likley to put up a fight and resist to an arrest or because they are more likely to be stopped in the first place. The first very small bar in our chart signifies that the gender of the victim is unknown.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to news reports 910 police officers had a body camera. 910/6594 – Only in 13.8% of all incidents in the data police officers has a body camera. I found this to actually be very surprising considering the number of states that are requiring their officers to wear body cameras. I think it possible that a portion of these deadly shootings could have been prevented if more officers were required to wear these cameras, because they create a sense of responsibility. There is no way to lie about the circumstances of a deadly shooting if there is videographic evidence of what occurred. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The victim was fleeing in 1903 of the incidents, 1058 by car and 845 by foot. There are 491 missing values in this dataset, if we include those in the calculation, the victim was fleeing in 1903/6594 – 28.85% of the cases. If we do not include the missing values, the victim was fleeing in 31.18% of cases. This is not what I expected because it shows that the police officer did not have much reason to shoot the victim in a fatal way. If the individual isn’t fleeing then they are most likely not a source of imminent danger to the public, meaning there must be another way to get control over them. I would have expected the proportion of victims fleeing to be at least 50%.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 first shows us that most of the victims were not fleeing. Secondly, it shows us that more police officers were wearing cameras when the victim was not fleeing compared to when they were. I wouldn’t exactly say that there is an association between the two considering that police officers probably cannot take off their body cameras in the middle of their shift simply because it is convenient for the situation. I do think it’s off to see how in how many of these fatal shootings there is actual video evidence of what happened. The first bar in our plot is unlabeled in the dataset, so we are unsure of what that represents. There is also an “other” category where we see a small percentage of body cameras being used. I think this leaves a lot to think about because we don’t know if people in this category were fleeing or if there actions were open to ambiguity. This sort of makes me question the rest of the data and why some things aren’t specifically described or how were circumstances categorized. But overall, we can conclude that in our data more police officers were wearing body cameras that may have recoded part of the incident when the victim was not fleeing compared to when they were fleeing.</strong></p>
